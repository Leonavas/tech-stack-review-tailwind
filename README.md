# Objective

This project aims to measure the time spent to create an interface using Tailwindcss

# Technologies

It uses vite and svelte for a faster development and is a implementation of an [awesome design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15675268--New-product-Rome-UI-kit-for-Figma-Mobile-desktop-templates) made by [Roman Kamushken](https://dribbble.com/kamushken)

And of course, it uses Tailwindcss

# Comparatives

Our devs will also replicate this design in Tailwindcss, aswell as using Material and Ionic components

# Conclusions

We'll add it after we get our results...
